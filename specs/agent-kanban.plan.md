# Agent Kanban — UI Test Plan

## Application Overview

Agent Kanban is a React SPA backed by a Hono API on Cloudflare Pages + D1. It provides an agent-first kanban board for managing AI-driven tasks. The app uses username/password authentication (Better Auth username plugin). The first run registers a single owner account (admin) through the bootstrap flow; public registration then stays locked forever. GitHub OAuth is available only as a post-login binding. After sign-in, users manage boards (5-column kanban), machines (daemon runners), agents (AI workers with cryptographic identity), and repositories. All pages except /auth and /auth/callback are behind a ProtectedRoute that redirects unauthenticated users to /auth.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Authentication

**Seed:** `tests/seed.spec.ts`

#### 1.1. Auth page renders username sign-in form when setup is complete

**File:** `tests/auth/auth-page-default-state.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Mock `GET /api/auth/bootstrap/status` to `{ registrationOpen: false, legacyEmailLoginEnabled: false }`
  2. Navigate to http://localhost:6265/auth
    - expect: The page title 'Agent Kanban' is visible with 'Kanban' in accent color
    - expect: The subtitle 'Sign in to your account' is visible
    - expect: A username input field is present
    - expect: A password input field is present
    - expect: A 'Sign In' submit button is visible
    - expect: No 'Continue with GitHub' button (GitHub is bind-only after sign-in)
    - expect: No 'Sign up' toggle link (registration is locked after bootstrap)
    - expect: No email input field

#### 1.2. First-run registration page

**File:** `tests/auth/auth-bootstrap-register.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Mock `GET /api/auth/bootstrap/status` to `{ registrationOpen: true, legacyEmailLoginEnabled: false }`
  2. Navigate to http://localhost:6265/auth
    - expect: The subtitle 'Create the owner account' is visible
    - expect: Display name, Username and Password input fields are present
    - expect: A 'Create owner account' submit button is visible
    - expect: No 'Continue with GitHub' button and no sign-in/sign-up toggle
  3. Fill Display name, Username and Password, then click 'Create owner account'
    - expect: `POST /api/auth/bootstrap/register` receives `{ username, name, password }`
    - expect: The user is redirected away from /auth

#### 1.3. Sign-in form validation — empty fields

**File:** `tests/auth/auth-signin-empty-validation.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Mock `GET /api/auth/bootstrap/status` to `{ registrationOpen: false, legacyEmailLoginEnabled: false }`
  2. Navigate to http://localhost:6265/auth
    - expect: Sign-in form is displayed
  3. Click the 'Sign In' button without entering any credentials
    - expect: The form does not submit
    - expect: Browser native validation or an error state prevents submission because the username field is required

#### 1.4. Sign-in with wrong credentials shows error

    - expect: An error message is displayed below the password field (styled with 'text-error')
    - expect: The user remains on the /auth page
    - expect: The submit button returns from its loading '...' state back to 'Sign In'

#### 1.5. Loading state is displayed during sign-in submission

**File:** `tests/auth/auth-signin-loading-state.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Mock `GET /api/auth/bootstrap/status` to `{ registrationOpen: false, legacyEmailLoginEnabled: false }` and delay `POST /api/auth/sign-in/username`
  2. Navigate to http://localhost:6265/auth
    - expect: Sign-in form is displayed with the 'Sign In' button
  3. Enter a username and password, then click 'Sign In'
    - expect: The submit button immediately changes its text to '...' and becomes disabled while the request is in flight
    - expect: The button re-enables (with the original label or with an error) once the response arrives

#### 1.6. Legacy email one-time login and username confirmation gate

**File:** `tests/auth/auth-legacy-username-confirm.spec.ts`

**Steps:**
  1. Create an unconfirmed legacy account fixture (`usernameConfirmed = 0`, real email present) in the local D1 database
  2. Mock `GET /api/auth/bootstrap/status` to `{ registrationOpen: false, legacyEmailLoginEnabled: true }`
  3. Navigate to http://localhost:6265/auth

    - expect: The user is redirected into the app; the gate no longer redirects on reload
  6. For an already-confirmed account, entering the old email at the legacy path
    - expect: A generic credential error and the user remains on /auth
    - expect: The same account still signs in with its username

#### 1.7. Auth callback page shows loading state
